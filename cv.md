  First of all, my goal is to develop, to contribute knowledge to myself in order to become better and better. Now I am 20 years old, I started programming in 2018 and during this time I managed to achieve a lot in this area, due to my perseverance and responsibility. I managed to work in 2 companies, at the moment I work in the company as a Frontend developer. I am a very fast learner and at my age I want to take the most out of this life and profession!
